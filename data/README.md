# Test Dataset

#### 1. The benchmark MD trajectories of 12 fast folding proteins (<a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.1208351">Shaw et al.</a>) and BPTI (<a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.1187409">Lindorff-Larsen et al.</a>) can be obtained from the original authors in D.E. Shaw Research (https://www.deshawresearch.com).


#### 2. The five distinct conformational clusters of the protein BPTI are available at  https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.1187409#supplementary-materials

#### 3. The closed and open conformations of the typical model protein AdK can be obtained at https://www.rcsb.org/structure/1AKE and https://www.rcsb.org/structure/4AKE, respectively.

#### 4. The alternative conformations of the 40 test proteins can be downloaded from https://zenodo.org/records/10837082 or retrieved from the RCSB using the PDB IDs listed in the Cfold40 folder.
